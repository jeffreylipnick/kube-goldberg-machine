# Kube Goldberg Machine
*An overly complicated Hello World app.*

## Overview
The purpose of this repo is to provide a space for me to explore a variety of technologies, best practices, and trade-offs.  On the job, there's always time constraints that limit my ability to dive as deeply as I'd like into subjects before making a decision.  This has lead me to have a number of open questions.

1. *Does following good practices really take that much longer?*  Often I hear the rationalization for taking shortcuts is that it will take significantly less time to complete the work. This is certainly true some of the time. However, following this methodology often leads to significant amounts of tech debt that never gets addressed.  This tech debt also slows down all future development and makes operating at scale a huge challenge.
2. *Does all of this stuff really have to be so complicated?*  Sure, working on an enterprise grade cloud environment is inherently complicated to a certain degree.  But what I see in practice is an explosion of technologies, convoluted glued together processes, and things that feel like they should be simple to me often don't pan out that way when implemented.
3. *What does a secure, scalable architecture actually look like in practice?*  All the products I've worked on up to this point have been either monoliths in the process of being decomposed into microservices or products that were microservices that went to market so fast that everything around them was a convoluted mess.  I want to give myself the chance to build out an architecture that is: easy to develop on, easy to test, easy to deploy, easy to scale, and is built with security in mind from the beginning.  My assumption is that by following good practices from the beginning that I will be able to achieve these goals.  I may be proven wrong, but that's the whole point of this exploration.

Beyond these open questions, there also technologies and domains that I haven't had a chance to explore yet myself such as scale testing.
